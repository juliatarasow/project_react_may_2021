major urban areas. Porto city proper, which is the entire municipality of Porto, is small compared to its metropolitan area, with an estimated population of just 215,945 people in a municipality with only 41.42 km2.[1][9] Porto's metropolitan area has around 1.7 million people (2019)[10] in an area of 2,395 km2 (925 sq mi),[11] making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal.[12][13][14] It is recognized as a global city with a Gamma + rating from the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.[15]\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Located along the Douro River estuary in northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centres, and its core was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996, as \"Historic Centre of Porto, Luiz I Bridge and Monastery of Serra do Pilar\". The historic area is also a National Monument of Portugal.[16] The western part of its urban area extends to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. Its settlement dates back many centuries, when it was an outpost of the Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, Portus Cale,[17] has been referred to as the origin of the name Portugal, based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin. In Portuguese, the name of the city includes a definite article: o Porto (\"the port\" or \"the harbor\"), which is where its English name \"Oporto\" comes from.[18]\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Port wine, one of Portugal's most famous exports, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in particular the cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport, and export of fortified wine.[19] In 2014 and 2017, Porto was elected The Best European Destination by the Best European Destinations Agency.[20] Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago. Porto is also the home of one of the country's most successful football clubs, FC Porto. </p>\n            </div>\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react'\n\nimport { CardView } from 'react-card-with-image'\nimport 'react-card-with-image/dist/index.css'\n\nimport { details } from './climateData.json'\n\nimport './climateCard.css'\n\nexport default function ClimateCard2 () {\n    // console.log('details', details)\n  \n  return (\n    <CardView\n      items={details}\n      activeColor='rgba(48, 71, 120, 0.85)'\n      imageHeight='auto'\n      imageWidth='100%'\n    />\n  )\n}\n","\nimport ClimateCard2 from '../../components/ClimateComp/ClimateCard2.jsx'\n\nimport './Climate.css'\n\n\nexport default function Climate() {  \n        \n    return (\n        <div>\n            <h1>Climate</h1>\n        \n        <div className=\"Climate\">\n\n            <p><b>Porto</b> and its metropolitan area feature a <b>Mediterranean climate</b> (Köppen: Csb) with mild wet winters and warm dry summers.

The Euro Health Consumer Index ranked Portuguese healthcare as the 13th best in Europe in 2018, up from 20th place in 2015. It ranks higher than the UK, Spain, Italy, and Ireland. Portuguese healthcare scored highest in terms of patient rights and information, accessibility and waiting times, as well as overall health outcomes. Portugal has an average life expectancy of 81 years.\n                                The National Health Service (SNS) is the system by which the State assures the right to the health protection, in the terms established by the Portuguese Constitution. It was created in 1979 and operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Health.\nThe SNS is characterized as being national, universal, general and free. It is national as it should be provided nationwide, although presently it still only covers Continental Portugal. It is universal as all Portuguese citizens and foreign residents have access to it. It is general as it encompasses the whole range of healthcare, including the health surveillance and promotion, the disease prevention, the diagnosis and treatment of patients and the social and medical rehabilitation. It is free, as the system is publicly funded, with the health services being tendentiously free of charge for the users.\nAlthough some hospitals continue to constitute themselves separate administrative hospital establishments, most of the hospital units are now administratively grouped in hospital super-establishments designated \"hospital centers\" (centros hospitalares). A next phase of hospital administration is being implemented, with the creation of comprehensive health mega-establishments designated \"local health units\" (unidades de saúde local, ULS). The ULS group not only the hospitals but also the health centers located in the same city or region, integrating the providing of both primary and secondary healthcare in a single administrative unit. Most of the public hospital establishments constitute State-owned enterprises (entidades públicas empresariais, EPE). However, some public hospitals are managed by private entities as public-private partnerships (PPP).'\n                                img='https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Portugal-public-health-system.png.webp'\n                            />\n                            <Paragraph\n                                head='Where to go if you need healthcare in Portugal'\n                                text='If you need healthcare in Portugal, you can visit your nearest health center for medical assistance.

The adhesion to them is mandatory for these groups of persons, with its financing being made either by the beneficiaries or by their employers. There are public and private subsystems, with the first type being responsible for the providing of healthcare to public servants and the second to the members of private organizations.\n\nThe most important public health subsystem is the ADSE, which covers all public servants not covered by other special schemes. ADSE has more than 1.3 million beneficiaries, including servants of the central, regional and local public administrations. The other public subsystems cover some special groups of public servants and are the ADM for the military personnel of the Armed Forces, the SAD/GNR for the military personnel of the National Republican Guard, the SAD/PSP for the police personnel of the Public Security Police and SSMJ for some special professional groups (prison guards, Judiciary Police agents, probation officers, etc.) of the Ministry of Justice.
