This is the city\'s most visible landmark, a 75-meter-tall, 18th-century granite-hewn rocket, and visiting this historic structure should be high up on the \'things to do\' list. You\'ll need a stout pair of legs to climb the 240 steps to the top of the tower, but the effort will be rewarded with a breathtaking panorama of the river, the coastline, and the distant Douro valley \u2014 a bird\'s-eye-view of Portugal\'s second largest city, and an inspiring way for first-time sightseers to get their bearings. Commissioned by the Brotherhood of the Clergy (cl\xe9rigos) and designed by the Italian-born Nicolau Nasoni, the Baroque tower complements the adjoining Igreja dos Cl\xe9rigos, which is also Nasoni\'s handiwork. Built between 1732 and 1750, the church itself is a wonderful example of the architect\'s affinity with the Baroque and features an elliptic floorplan, one of the first churches in Portugal built in such a way.","map":"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d6993.170414523526!2d-8.615493589436683!3d41.142180217646455!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0xd2464e251ced649%3A0x70c16361c3de59f0!2sIgreja%20dos%20Cl%C3%A9rigos!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1621275600342!5m2!1sen!2sde"},{"id":2,"title":"Ponte Dom Lu\xeds I","image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1569959220744-ff553533f492?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=745&q=80","description":"The grandiose Dom Lu\xeds I bridge is one of the most iconic structures in Portugal.","more":"The grandiose Dom Lu\xeds I bridge is one of the most iconic structures in Portugal.

The heavily riveted charcoal-grey ironwork has Gustave Eiffel written all over it, and indeed it was an assistant of the great French engineer who built the bridge in 1886. Commuters use the bridge on a daily basis \u2014 a road, Avenida da Rep\xfablica, runs across the lower deck while the upper span accommodates a metro railway line.

It\'s also the departure point for numerous Douro River cruise boats. Adding a wonderfully nostalgic perspective is the fleet of traditional barcos rabelos moored alongside the esplanade. These graceful sailing vessels were once used to ferry casks downriver from the Douro port estates, and with Porto\'s Ribeira district providing a suitably romantic backdrop, sightseers are regaled with an atmospheric cityscape, a tableaux reminiscent of the 18th century. For a truly dramatic outlook, take a ride on the Telef\xe9rico de Gaia, or cable car.

In fact, the elegant golden-brushed woodwork is among the finest examples of Portuguese Rococo. The neighboring Igreja das Carmelitas is less of an eye-opener. Incredibly, dividing both is a house, built to comply with an ancient law that stipulated that no two churches were to share the same wall. Many believe this to be the narrowest private residence in the country, although it\'s been unoccupied for nearly 30 years.

Depart from here on the \'Riverside Line\' to trundle west all the way to the coastal town of Foz do Douro, situated at the mouth of the River Douro and known for its nearby beaches and coves. This leisurely excursion is a favorite option in summer, when you want to escape the city heat. Line 18 is restored track, part circular in design and the shortest ride. The route passes Igreja do Carmo and ends, suitably, at the Museu do Carro El\xe9ctrico, the tram museum. Arguably the most rewarding circuit in terms of sightseeing and attractions is the Line 22 tour.

Look out for smiling cherubs and dour-faced monks as you edge towards the north wall and S\xe3o Francisco\'s Tree of Jesse, a family tree in gilded and painted wood depicting Christ\'s genealogy. An extraordinary and beguiling artifact carved between 1718 and 1721, the tree boasts fine detail seen in the expressions of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and other figures, including King David, Solomon, and Jesse himself, which leaves onlookers speechless.

The Euro Health Consumer Index ranked Portuguese healthcare as the 13th best in Europe in 2018, up from 20th place in 2015. It ranks higher than the UK, Spain, Italy, and Ireland. Portuguese healthcare scored highest in terms of patient rights and information, accessibility and waiting times, as well as overall health outcomes. Portugal has an average life expectancy of 81 years. The National Health Service (SNS) is the system by which the State assures the right to the health protection, in the terms established by the Portuguese Constitution. It was created in 1979 and operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Health.\nThe SNS is characterized as being national, universal, general and free. It is national as it should be provided nationwide, although presently it still only covers Continental Portugal. It is universal as all Portuguese citizens and foreign residents have access to it. It is general as it encompasses the whole range of healthcare, including the health surveillance and promotion, the disease prevention, the diagnosis and treatment of patients and the social and medical rehabilitation. It is free, as the system is publicly funded, with the health services being tendentiously free of charge for the users.\nAlthough some hospitals continue to constitute themselves separate administrative hospital establishments, most of the hospital units are now administratively grouped in hospital super-establishments designated "hospital centers" (centros hospitalares). A next phase of hospital administration is being implemented, with the creation of comprehensive health mega-establishments designated "local health units" (unidades de sa\xfade local, ULS). The ULS group not only the hospitals but also the health centers located in the same city or region, integrating the providing of both primary and secondary healthcare in a single administrative unit. Most of the public hospital establishments constitute State-owned enterprises (entidades p\xfablicas empresariais, EPE).

The health subsystems are the special schemes - parallel to the SNS - responsible for the providing of healthcare to the members of certain professions or organizations. The adhesion to them is mandatory for these groups of persons, with its financing being made either by the beneficiaries or by their employers. There are public and private subsystems, with the first type being responsible for the providing of healthcare to public servants and the second to the members of private organizations. The most important public health subsystem is the ADSE, which covers all public servants not covered by other special schemes. ADSE has more than 1.3 million beneficiaries, including servants of the central, regional and local public administrations. The other public subsystems cover some special groups of public servants and are the ADM for the military personnel of the Armed Forces, the SAD/GNR for the military personnel of the National Republican Guard, the SAD/PSP for the police personnel of the Public Security Police and SSMJ for some special professional groups (prison guards, Judiciary Police agents, probation officers, etc.) of the Ministry of Justice.

To ensure costs are covered, you will need to check that your doctor is contracted to offer services though the public healthcare system in Portugal.
